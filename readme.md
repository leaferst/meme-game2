        Start button hit:
            'Pick a caption' display a random meme
                If the meme has been used that game, don't use it again.
            Input box
            Submit

            Once all users have submitted (or timeout?punishment?)
            Display the meme again and all caption submissions

            Everybody clicks on a meme to hand out their vote
                Just an idea: 2 thumbs up and 1 thumbs down to each player to put on a caption?

            After voting: display the caption authors

        Start the next round and keep track of all of the likes and dislikes
